To do so, they must constantly monitor innovations and tools that best lay sound foundations for their growth. This is why special attention must be paid when it comes to investing in their information systems and defending such investments from the risk of deterioration.</p>
							<p>Applications represent a return on investment only if they combine excellent performance standards with real reliability and expandability features.
