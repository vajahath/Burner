				<p>Maximize your training time and turbo-charge your career in security by learning the full Inter Land Security Essentials curriculum needed to qualify for the GSEC certification. In this track you will learn the language and underlying theory of computer security. At the same time you will learn the essential, up-to-the-minute knowledge and skills required for effective performance if you are given the responsibility for securing systems and/or organizations. This course meets both of the key promises Inter Land makes to our students: (1) You will gain up-to-the-minute knowledge you can put into practice immediately upon returning to work; and, (2) You will be taught by the best security instructors in the industry. As always, great teaching sets Inter Land courses apart, and Inter Land ensures this by choosing instructors who have ranked highest in a nine-year competition among potential security faculty.</p>
